# 💡 Discovered a Cool Tool — Lenspect by VirusTotal

Thanks to the **Linux Unplugged** podcast, I came across **Lenspect by VirusTotal** — an open-source binary inspection tool for Linux.

## 🎧 How I Discovered It
While tuning into the *Linux Unplugged* podcast (Episode 638), amongst other things, what caught my attention was **Lenspect**.  
Since I'm a Linux user and I follow Cyber Security as my profession, this tool instantly caught my interest.

## 🧠 What Is This Tool?

To put it simply, this is a **binary inspection and visualization tool inspired by VirusTotal**, designed for Linux machines.  
It integrates with VirusTotal via an API key (optional) so you can combine local binary inspection with VirusTotal lookups and metadata.  

**Lenspect** lets you visually inspect binary files like **ELF** and **PE**, showing headers, sections, and metadata in a graphical layout.  
It’s perfect for reverse engineers, security researchers, or anyone who loves exploring what’s inside executables.

## 🧰 My Experience

The app not being available in Debian-based systems' default app manager (`apt`) was a small inconvenience — but a valid one since it’s still in early development.  
The need to manually build it with **Flatpak** was another minor bump, but thanks to the clear documentation and instructions in the GitHub repo, the process was smooth and pleasant.

According to my experience, the main difference compared to the traditional VirusTotal web interface is that this functions as an **app** and not a **webpage**.

## ⚙️ Why I Liked It

Unlike VirusTotal’s online interface, **Lenspect** runs fully offline and locally — giving you control, privacy, and a clean visual way to analyze binaries right from Linux. When combined with the VirusTotal API, it also provides enhanced lookup and metadata capabilities.
